###In a Nutshell

_Introduction_
_Installation_
_Updating_
_Creating Users_
_Conclusion_

###Introduction

This guide serves two purposes. Firstly, it acts as a self-documenting tool to journal the author's progress. Secondly it compiles the author's shorthand notes into something from which other users may be able to learn.

The goal is, through the use of software, to develop a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) into a functional coding and development computer.

This guide assumes a fair knowledge of [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and command line computing. If the previous guide, _Automatic TV Show Torrents on Kodi_, was a fairly breezy affair, then this guide is probably written at the right level for you.

###Installation

Head to the [Raspberry Pi website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) and download the latest NOOBS torrent.

While that's downloading, download a formatting tool for your SD card, such as [the official one](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/). Plug in your SD card and wipe it using the tool.

Unzip the contents of the NOOBS Zip file into the root directory of the SD card. Now it's good to go.

You'll need to plug your Raspberry Pi into a display of some sort. I used my television and a spare keyboard. Don't forget to plug in a network cable. NOOBS doesn't have the full Arch installation files by default, and it has to download some to complete the installation. Start up your Raspberry Pi and when you get to the NOOBS installation screen, choose Arch Linux. NOOBS will automatically download and install Arch for you.

Why choose Arch Linux? Because it's notoriously difficult, won't hold your hand and you'll have to learn how everything works. It's also light, always up to date and won't weigh down your Pi. Once NOOBS is finished installing, you are faced with the default `tty` text terminal. Log in using the username `root` and the password `root`.

###Updating

Arch Linux is cool because it doesn't have versions. Instead, it conforms to a [Rolling Release Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release) whereby every application (in the whole operating system) is simply kept up-to-date. In other Linux distributions, or for example Windows, there are a certain base group of programs that make up the operating system. These are treated as _sacred_ and are only updated during an operating system upgrade. In Arch, nothing is sacred. Each and every package of the operating system is updated to the latest version.

The first order of business is using the Arch _package manager_ called `pacman` to update the _whole_ operating system.

1.  Update the package database: `pacman -Sy`
2.  Update the packages: `pacman -Syu`

You'll get used to the second command. I use it every time I log into my Pi, because it keeps everything up-to-date, completely automatically.

###Creating Users

Let's start with some basic packages to allow us a bit more control. Of course Arch Linux doesn't have these packages installed by default. It's part of the [Arch Linux Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux) where simplicity means that a default installation like ours has _absolutely_ no unnecessary packages. For example `pacman` is quite necessary for the operating system to install and run, but what following programs I recommend are not.

1.  [Sudo][1]: `pacman -S sudo`
2.  [Vim][2]: `pacman -S vim`
  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo
  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim(text_editor)

We've been running all our commands as root, which is fine for a start but always has the risk of deleting something you don't want to by running a command you weren't familiar with or running a program with root permissions. It's generally considered a [bad idea](http://askubuntu.com/questions/16178/why-is-it-bad-to-login-as-root) in the Linux world.. Although some would argue it's something I've carried over from my Ubuntu days, I would suggest it important not to login as root in order to comply with the Linux security model. Let's make a new user in the `wheel` group:

`useradd -m -g wheel dancingborg`

The _wheel_ user group is a [historic Linux term][1], and is generally associated with an elevated user group that has privileges greater than a normal user but less than an administrator or root account.
  [1]:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_(Unix_term)

Now let's give that user a password using the `passwd` command. This will bring up a prompt asking for you to enter a password and then confirm that password as the password for your new user.

`passwd dancingborg`

###Conclusion

Hopefully this initial theory lesson has given you a picture of where in the world of computing you are operating and how the system with which you are interacting came to be.

In the next part of this guide we will learn about the terminal, how it works and how it is a powerful way to interact with your computer.

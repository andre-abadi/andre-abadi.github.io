# Actions
- Read the reference articles
- Tentatively decided on the [PAD-11 from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com.au/precision-universal-crimping-inter-changeable-ENGINEER/dp/B00IWD9XT6/ref=sr_1_2?crid=PCL57827CKFS&keywords=pad-11+engineer&qid=1648646027&sprefix=pad-11+engine%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-2)

# Reflections
- [PAD-02](https://rhinotools.com.au/product/engineer-pad-02-crimping-kit/) is a PAD-11 with PAD-12 and PAD-13 dies, but is ~$200AUD
- [Amazon PAD-11](https://www.amazon.com.au/precision-universal-crimping-inter-changeable-ENGINEER/dp/B00IWD9XT6/ref=sr_1_2?crid=PCL57827CKFS&keywords=pad-11+engineer&qid=1648646027&sprefix=pad-11+engine%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-2) is $96 AUD with free delivery
- Can get a [PAD-12 die from Rhino Tools](https://rhinotools.com.au/product/pad-12s-die/) for ~$31AUD if requiring additional dies, still cheaper than Amazon or Rhino PAD-02 kit
- Might be worth checking on Voron Discord which crimping sizes are required for the build, as the [Official Voron Buying FAQ](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing_faq.html) suggests the PA-09 is a good tool, implying it has all the correct crimping die sizes

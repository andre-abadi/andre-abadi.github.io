# Purpose
- Track total cost of purchase and assembly of Voron 2.4 printer

# Actions
- Requested swap to 300mm model
- Swap done with following caveats from [Unique Prints](https://uniqueprints.shop/) rep:
  - > The difference in price can be used as credit for future orders - just let me know what you are after and I'll make a customer order for you with the credit included in the price.
  - > The only potential issue is the 300 kits that have already been ordered are not in red but Space Grey.
  - > If I have a 300 red frame when your kit comes in i'll just swap that in for the grey frame.

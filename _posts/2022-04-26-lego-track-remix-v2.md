# Purpose
- Update the 3d printed track parts to fit Lego City train tracks
- Further lazy-fi the designs to make them easier to print

# Actions
- Tested V1 parts on actual [Lego City Passenger Train](https://brickset.com/sets/7938-1/Passenger-Train)
- Found that the adjustable bend originals fitted the printed parts
- Found that the static originals did not fit the printed parts
- Printed parts had a small part lacking the cutout required
- Used a stanley knife to cut out part of the printed tracks
- Printed tracks subsequently fitted the original tracks
- Back to [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1uMkrkHizta-lego-train-track)
- Rotate some cubes and lop out the necessary parts (see picture)
- Lopped off the top nodules since
  - Unlikely to be used
  - Increase print time
  - On testing, were too loose to fit Lego pieces anyway

# Reflections
- Overall a well executed plan and adaptation to real-world scenario
- Could have just printed a single track (instead of a straight and a curved) to the same diagnostic value

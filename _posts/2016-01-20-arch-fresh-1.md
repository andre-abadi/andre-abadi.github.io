###Introduction

Head to the [Raspberry Pi website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) and download the latest NOOBS torrent.

While that's downloading, download a formatting tool for your SD card, such as [the official one](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/). Plug in your SD card and wipe it using the tool.

Unzip the contents of the NOOBS Zip file into the root directory of the SD card. Now it's good to go.

You'll need to plug your Raspberry Pi into a display of some sort. I used my television and a spare keyboard. Don't forget to plug in a network cable. NOOBS doesn't have the full Arch installation files by default, and it has to download some to complete the installation. Start up your Raspberry Pi and when you get to the NOOBS installation screen, choose Arch Linux. NOOBS will automatically download and install Arch for you.

Why choose Arch Linux? Because it's notoriously difficult, won't hold your hand and you'll have to learn how everything works. It's also light, always up to date and won't weigh down your Pi. Once NOOBS is finished installing, you are faced with the default `tty` text terminal. Log in using the username `root` and the password `root`.

###Pacman

Force upgrade of all package lists, even if they appear up to date:

  `pacman -Syy`
>[Reference 1](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Packages_cannot_be_retrieved_on_installation)
>[Reference 2](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1403731#p1403731)

###Keyring

Initialise the Pacman keyring database:

  `pacman-key --init`
>[Reference]( https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Package_signing#Initializing_the_keyring)

Manually update the keyring package:

  `pacman -S archlinux-keyring`
>[Reference](  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#Signature_from_.22User_.3Cemail.40gmail.com.3E.22_is_unknown_trust.2C_installation_failed)

Verify the five  master keys:

  `pacman-key --populate archlinux`
>[Reference](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Package_signing#Verifying_the_five_master_keys)

Update the all known keys now that the database has been initialised and the master keys are known:

  `pacman-key --refresh-keys`
>[Reference](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#Signature_from_.22User_.3Cemail.40gmail.com.3E.22_is_unknown_trust.2C_installation_failed)

###Upgrade

Upgrade all packages:

  `pacman -Syu`
>[Reference](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Upgrading_packages)

Upgrade Pacman database because Pacman itself has been updated and its internal database is out of date:

  `pacman-db-upgrade`

###SSH

Disable deprecated "Diffie-Hellman group exchange" key exchange on PuTTY to allow SSH connection now that OpenSSH package has been updated to disallow this type of key exchange. Otherwise SSH attempts just have no result.

To see error, check the SSH daemon logs for error:

  `journalctl -u sshd -n 100`

On your Windows (or other) computer, open PuTTY (or other terminal emulator) and check that the above key exchange method is not used.

    PuTTY
    -->Connection
      -->SSH
        -->Kex
          -->"Diffie-Hellman group exchange" to bottom of list

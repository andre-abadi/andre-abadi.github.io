# Purpose
- Fix the bridge from a *Brio Style* toy train set, that had been partially squashed
- Make something that would keep it strong

# References
- Self made design:
  - Thingiverse: [Toy Bridge Splint Fix](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5090340)
  - Github: [Toy Bridge Fix](/asset/stl/2021-11-03-toy-bridge-fix.stl)

# Actions
- Calipers to measure up the dimensions
- Simple design prototyped on [TinkerCAD](tinkercad.com)
- Printed in PolyMaker PolyTerra PLA Cotton White
- Functionally ended up being 100% infill
- Slid into place and filled with much more polyurethane than typical, to fill the large spaces
- Waited 12hrs
- Used a sharp knife to cut off protruding parts of expanded foam

# Observations
- Was probably too thing and flexible (walls only 2mm thick)
- A thicker design would have put more pressure on the glue to make it stronger
- It ended up being strong enough to do the job
- 3mm wall thickness would have probably been the perfect balance between strength and material use
- Still worked really well with generous amounts of polyurethane to make a strong part
- Polyurethane filling gaps in PLA can make very strong structures

# Purpose
- Celebrate a friend getting a Nintendo Switch
- Make something cool with some awesome retro vibes

# References

# Actions
- Downloaded STLs
- Printed outer case in PolyTerra red and inner case in PolyTerra blue
- Deployed 0.8mm nozzle for crazy fast print times, under 2hrs per piece
- Printed a NES cartridge label and used ordinary double sided tape to adhere it where the label goes
- Added a felt pad inside to help the tray fit into the holder as, by default, it slides very easily in and out
- Some of the first overhanging layers didn't adhere properly so used hot air to secure them

# Reflections
- Good design, good print, wouldn't have changed anything too much if I had had the chance

# Purpose
- Dry filament that has absorbed moisture
- Dry dessicant beads

# References
- [K-mart Food Dehydrator](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/food-dehydrator/3419823) $49

# Actions
- Installed in garage
- Used angular snips to remove interior meshes from all but bottom level
  - This was sufficient to store a standard 1Kg spool of filament
  - Figured could always cut the last one if needed but this would be better than having things to dry touching bottom

# Observations
- Drying loose dessicant beads is difficult as need either a flat tray or only top most tend to dry out
- Didn't use as much as expected
- Does dry filament well
- Max temperature 70 degrees Celsius was a bit short of the maximum 80 for ASA
  - That said it appeared to work well for ASA

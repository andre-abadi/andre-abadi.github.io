# Purpose
- Reuse HX711 and smart bed occupancy sensors in a new bed

# References
- [Thingiverse: Smart Bed occupancy sensor](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4213002)

# Actions
- Cut up wires from load cells previously hardwired to HX711 with soldered wires
- Replaced wire-ends from each load cell with three-abreast DuPont sockets
- Researched again how a wheatstone bridge worked
- Eventually referred back again to the original [Thingiverse design pictures](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4213002)
- Archived here, hope the original author (BTB [Lukáš Porubčan](https://www.thingiverse.com/luc3as/designs)) for posterity

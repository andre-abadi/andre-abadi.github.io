# Observations
- Hexagonal holes add lots of print time
- Hexagonal holes add complexity
- Hexagonal holes increase the amount of high speed non-print moves
- Parts with very little bed contact area are prone to detach 
- Screw hole size was perfect
- Didn't need to be anywhere near as wide as originally planned (30mm)

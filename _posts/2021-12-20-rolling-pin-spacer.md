# Actions
- Measured diameters of
  - Rolling pin
  - Holes in existing spacers
  - Outer diameter of existing spacers
- [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) some new ones
- Create STLs
- Print STLs


# Reflections
- On a few sizes, forgot to ensure that middle cutouts were exactly in the centre, resulting in a few failed prints
- Other than the above, these worked perfectly
- The original spacers are not as accurate to their sizing as was expected, some were up to 0.3mm off

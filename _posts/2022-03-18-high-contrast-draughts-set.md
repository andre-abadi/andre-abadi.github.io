# Purpose
- Create a high contrast draughts board for use by an elderly family member with low vision

# References
- [Chess - Schach & Checkers - Draughts - Dame Board & Box](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/63050-chess-schach-checkers-draughts-dame-board-box)


# Actions
- Printed V2 of the design files
- Base in PolyTerra black and white
- V2 did not fit together to make the boxes, appears V2 did, according to 
- Printing at 0.5mm layer height resulted in filament holes/channels of insufficient size
- Printing with 0.6mm nozzle resulted in loss of detail in legends
- Removed legends from board frame by doing Z-splits in PrusaSlicer
- Clamped four quarters of board together, drilled holes and screwed the four quarters of the baord together
- Cyanoacrylate used to glue tiles onto board base
- Printed the pieces in PolyTerra blue and red


# Observations
- PolyTerra red is gorgeous
- Should have printed V1 as the online description says it was tried and tested, where as the online description warned that V2 was untested
- 0.6mm nozzle isn't great at lettering

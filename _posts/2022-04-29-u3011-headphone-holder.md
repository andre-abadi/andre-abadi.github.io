# Purpose
- Design a headphone holder for my [Audio Technica ATH-D500](https://www.whathifi.com/au/audio-technica/ath-a500/review)s to fit the conveniently big bezels of my [Dell U3011](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/dell-ultrasharp-u3011-review/) monitor

# Design Files
- [`u3011-headphone-holder.stl`](https://github.com/andre-abadi/andre-abadi.github.io/blob/master/assets/stl/2022-04-29-u3011-headphone-holder.stl)


# Actions
- Measured up the big ol' bezels on the U3011
- Off to TinkerCAD to iterate some prototypes
- Added 2 degree decline so headphone stay on end of holder
- Added 22.5 degree tilt toward rear so headphones did not protrude from front of monitor
- Made it so it could print without supports by making the *back* the *bottom*
- Printed PolyTerra black, 0.6mm nozzle, 0.4mm layer height, 2 vertical walls, 15% gyroid infill

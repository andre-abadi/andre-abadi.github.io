# Purpose
- Make the [IKEA Rothult](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/rothult-smart-lock-white-80429620/) fit to the [IKEA Enhet](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/enhet-mirror-cabinet-with-2-doors-white-s39396566/)
- Make the [IKEA Enhet](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/enhet-mirror-cabinet-with-2-doors-white-s39396566/) more kid-safe for use as a medicine cabinet

- [Cabinet Socket (Unused)](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-cabinet-socket.stl)
- [Door Socket](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-door-socket.stl)
- [Door Tab](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-door tab.stl)

# Actions
- The [Rothult](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/rothult-smart-lock-white-80429620/) when placed behind the mirrors of the  [Enhet](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/enhet-mirror-cabinet-with-2-doors-white-s39396566/), likely due to the metal backing of the mirror panels
- Designed and 3D printed some adapters
- Used the self-designed [Door Tab](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-door tab.stl) to stop the left door opening if the right door was locked
- Screwed the [Rothult](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/rothult-smart-lock-white-80429620/) to the ceiling of the [Enhet](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/enhet-mirror-cabinet-with-2-doors-white-s39396566/), behind the right door
- First time screwing [Rothult](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/rothult-smart-lock-white-80429620/) didn't work because holding by hand caused it to slide into the unit, which I could not afford due to tight tolerances of the [Door Socket](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-door-socket.stl)
- Removed top shelf of [Enhet](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/enhet-mirror-cabinet-with-2-doors-white-s39396566/) and F-clamped [Rothult](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/rothult-smart-lock-white-80429620/) to the correct position, then screwed it in
- A rubber bumper on the door added distance from the [Rothult](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/rothult-smart-lock-white-80429620/) latch, too much for tolerance of the [Door Socket](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-door-socket.stl)
- Placed a piece of plastic between the [Door Socket](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-door-socket.stl) and the door, then re-screwed, resulting in correct offset and bolt correctly inserting into [Door Socket](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-door-socket.stl) when door was closed


# Observations
- Should have removed shelving to make drilling work easier the first time, refer unused screw hole in second picture
- Should have measured tolerances in-situ to have noticed the rubber bumper on the door that added 2mm to the length of the [Door Socket](/assets/stl/2022-03-25-rothult-cabinet-adapters-door-socket.stl) required

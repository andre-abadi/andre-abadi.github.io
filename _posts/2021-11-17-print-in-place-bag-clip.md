# Purpose
- Functional print to soak up some old PLA lying around

# References
- [Bag Clip (PRINT IN PLACE CAM)](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/27216-bag-clip-print-in-place-cam)


# Actions
- Printed using some old PLA
  - 0.15mm layer height as recommended
  - Otherwise used an old *strength* profile with 150% extrusion width on a 0.4mm nozzle
- First print didn't work, axial snapped on first try
- Printed again using 0.15 tolerance project file
- Worked the second time

# Observations
- 0.1mm support seperation was hard to remove, to try again with about 0.17mm
- 0.1mm tolerances were insufficient to make this print work but 0.15mm tolerances were thankfully provided and did work

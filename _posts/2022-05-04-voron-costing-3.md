# Reflections
- Need to buy some ABS to make the remaining colour-matched parts
  - Amazon Basic ABS Red
  - eSun ABS+ Black
- Did not know about the LDO kit upgrade fee, but glad PIF covers the LDO kit variations, seems very reasonable for quite a few changes
- PayPal currency conversions hurt, but then, currency conversions probably just hurt
- Happy to get quality parts from my provider rather than unregulated open market
- Still need a Raspberry Pi ~$100

# Purpose
- Helping a friend's child in year 5 who had a solar system science project
- Friend wanted to scale print a solar system

# Actions
- Full scale Earth started printing in the evening and was catching the nozzle on the edges
- Bottom of model was well adhered but edges seemed to be lifting up, possibly not enough heat was shed between layers?
- Left it to print anyway (critical error)
- Woke up to error at 4:00am
- Hotend was still hot so pulled the blob off, severing the thermistor cable
- Much smell, odd smell too, but probably the least bad smelling filament to have this happen with
- Disassembled extruder and hotend assembly
  - No plastic on extruder assembly and plastic damage limited to hotend assembly
  - Extruder assembly set aside
  - Hotend assembly disassembled
  - Heater block completely covered in burnt plastic
  - Nozzle heavily discolored

# Observations
- 0.1mm support seperation was hard to remove, to try again with about 0.17mm

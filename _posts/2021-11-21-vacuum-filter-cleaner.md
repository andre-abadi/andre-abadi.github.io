# Purpose
- Effectively clean filter for iRobot Roomba i7+
  - Requires cleaning twice a week
  - Previously completed by using brush head of Dyson stick vacuum
- Inspired by [Adaptor to clean roomba filter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:272203) by [mread](https://www.thingiverse.com/mread/designs)
  - That one used a bike pump for ++ static pressure but was for a different style of filter

- [Dyson v6 drill dust collector](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3571803)

# Actions
- TinkerCAD a new design
- Used Dyson V6 plug from [Dyson v6 drill dust collector](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3571803)
- Numerous iterations to get a good seal on the filter
  - Filter slightly tapered to seal well into the vacuum, clever design
  - Stops added to inside walls to prevent over-insertion of filter

# Observations
- Effective seal obtained
- Gradual increase in vacuum force as typical in household vacuum does not remove much of the caked in dust
- Less effective than using the V6 brush head to brush out the dust
- Much less effective than repeatedly hitting the filter against the side of the sink
- Overall a good exercise in designing things but superfluous
